Abstract

This applied software project presents the development of a comprehensive movie ticket booking platform, inspired by BookMyShow. The project implements a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, incorporating modern software development practices and industry-standard security measures.

The platform facilitates seamless movie ticket booking experiences for users while providing theater partners with efficient management tools and administrators with robust control mechanisms. Key features include user authentication, movie and theater management, show scheduling, seat selection, secure payment processing, and automated email notifications.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of crucial e-commerce functionalities including secure payment gateway integration (Razorpay), cloud storage for media files (AWS S3), and real-time email notifications. The system's architecture emphasizes scalability, security, and user experience, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Project Description

The BookMyShow Clone is a comprehensive movie ticket booking platform that connects moviegoers with theaters while providing a seamless booking experience. The project implements three distinct user roles:

1. Regular Users: Can browse movies, book tickets, and manage their bookings
2. Theater Partners: Can manage their theaters, shows, and view revenue
3. Administrators: Have overall system control and approval authority

[Insert system_architecture.txt diagram]

The system architecture follows a three-tier design pattern:
1. Client Layer (Frontend):
   - React.js application
   - Redux for state management
   - Material UI components
   - React Router for navigation

2. Application Layer:
   - Express.js REST API
   - Authentication middleware
   - Business logic implementation
   - External service integration

3. Data Layer:
   - MongoDB database
   - AWS S3 storage
   - Cache management
   - Data persistence

Figure 1.2: Database Schema
[Insert database_schema.txt diagram]

The database schema illustrates the relationships between different entities in the system:
1. User-Theater Relationship:
   - One-to-many relationship between Partner and Theater
   - Partners can manage multiple theaters
   - Admins can approve/reject theaters

2. Movie-Show Relationship:
   - One-to-many relationship
   - Movies can have multiple shows
   - Shows are linked to specific theaters

3. Booking-Payment Relationship:
   - One-to-one relationship
   - Each booking has associated payment information
   - Payment status tracking

const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
    amount: totalAmount * 100,
    currency: 'INR',
    receipt: booking._id.toString()
});

// Frontend Payment Initiation
const options = {
    key: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID,
    amount: order.amount,
    currency: order.currency,
    name: 'BookMyShow Clone',
    order_id: order.id,
